# The-Resistance-Avalon
-
This was a simplistic digital app of the game "The Resistance: Avalon". I made this in early 2025 in order to play with some friends without buying the physical board game and was learning introductory Python at the time; devloped to improve coding skills although modern LLMs can easily reproduce this.  Contains all versions; 2.3.1 is the main.

This READ ME goes over what's included in the app and it's limitations, if you choose to use this.
Additionally, if you are not familiar with the game The Resistance: Avalon, or sister gamed, I'd highly reccomend that you learn; visit https://avalon-game.com/wiki/rules/ . It is a social deduction game similar to Mafia or Werewolf, but with a lesser number of players and alternative game mechanics.

Characters:
Merlin / Assassin
Percival / Morgana
Oberon
Mordred

Mechanics:
Contains all normal game mechanics with one exception. The device locally runs the game and is meant to be passed around to each player to distribute roles and vote. "Communal" aspects of the game are meant to be shown to everyone. Intermediary screens are present as well. Additionally, historical mission data and mission leaders are present, allowing for recordkeeping of relevant gameplay and deduction information.
exception: when there are 5 rejected mission proposals, the Evil Alliance does not automatically win the game. Instead, the mission for the respective round is marked as "Failed" and the game continues as needed.

Limitations:
The game is limited to 10 players as I did not anticipate further development or need for the program. Additionally, there is no system for going backwards in gameplay; this was done for simplicity, but the whole file must be re-run each game. Missteps ouccurring within a game cannot be appended while the app is running. Finally, the game itself is in a quite large executable file as it includes superflous python modules not used in running of the program; this must be re-executed each time a game is played.
Apart from the listed limitations no known bugs are present.


To reiterate, this is a simplistic, locally-ran app to mediate a game of The Resistance: Avalon.
