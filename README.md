# The-Resistance-Avalon
This was a simplistic digital app of the game "The Resistance: Avalon". I made this in early 2025 in order to play with some friends without buying the physical board game and was learning introductory Python at the time; devloped to improve coding skills although modern LLMs can easily reproduce this.  Contains all versions; 2.3.1 is the main.
